I. (0 points) Preparation:

Modify your Lab 02 solution so that in addition to adding new words to the dictionary, you
can also search, sort, delete and modify them.
When displaying the list of words, it should be possible to sort the entire list according to
the selected language, both descending and ascending lexicographically.
Instead of a CVS file, use the H2 database saved to a file (in the workspace directory).
Make sure that if the database is not yet saved, it is created and filled with initial records,
and if the database file already exists, no attempt is made to create it again and fill it with
data.

your index number.
